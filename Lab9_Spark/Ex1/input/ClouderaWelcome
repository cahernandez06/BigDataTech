Get Started
The tutorial below guides you through some analytic use cases, using the most popular open source tools 
included with CDH (including Cloudera Impala, Cloudera Search, and Hue). 

Analyze Your Data
Hue is the open source web interface for Hadoop that lets you analyze your data. Simply load in your data 
and then easily begin to analyze, search, and visualize it. In the QuickStart VM, the administrative username 
for Hue is 'cloudera' and the password is 'cloudera'.

Manage Your Cluster
Cloudera Manager provides end-to-end system management for simple deployment and administration of CDH. Cloudera 
Manager also seamlessly integrates with existing third-party tools.

Click "Launch Cloudera Express" or "Launch Cloudera Enterprise (trial)" on the Desktop to get started.
